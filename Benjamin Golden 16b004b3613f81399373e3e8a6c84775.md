**Ad Text:** This Shopify theme setting is destroying your SEO traffic and negatively impacting your overall organic revenue. By default, Shopify is set to generate dynamic URLs for every single product in a collection page. This means that if you have one product in 5 different collections, you will essentially have 5 completely different URLs. Even though Shopify does include a canonical tag, which tells Google that these pages are the same, Google still needs to do all that extra crawling, just to understand that these pages are not duplicates. So how is this negatively affecting your Shopify rankings and organic revenue?Instead of using Google‚Äôs limited crawl budget on those duplicated URLs, we could be using it to have Google pay more attention to our collections, product, and blog pages, and with that, increase our overall visibility. How do you fix this?It‚Äôs as simple as going into your Shopify theme.liquid file, and disabling dynamic product URLs. This will allow us to link from a collection page directly to the final product page URL, and eliminate all of the other URL variations. Best of all?This doesn‚Äôt turn the OLD URLs into 404 pages, those will still work and load just fine, in case someone lands on them.üëâ Do you want 134 additional Shopify SEO Quick-Win opportunities just like this one?Click the link below, and check out the Shopify SEO Checklist with over 135 Quick-Wins and Step-by-Step Guides, trusted by over 1,000 Shopify Entrepreneurs.üëá

**Ad Text:** I‚Äôve been an online entrepreneur since the age of 12, today I own 8 different businesses that generate over 6-figures in profit every single month, and here's the full breakdown. The first and the biggest business I own and dedicate most of my time to is GoldenWeb, a Shopify-focused SEO agency and aggregator specializing in scaling brands with free organic traffic. I started it back in 2017, and it‚Äôs been growing at a pace of about 50% year after year for the last few years. It‚Äôs the business I‚Äôm most passionate about, not only because we were able to generate over $29.6M in additional organic revenue for our clients in the past 2 years alone, but because of the incredible team that I get to lead and work with. Even though we‚Äôre growing extremely fast, I know we‚Äôre just getting started and I can‚Äôt wait to see all the hard work continue to materialize. The second business is a business that operates completely passively, yet still generates solid cashflow - it‚Äôs an Amazon affiliate business built with SEO, here‚Äôs how it works. I have websites ranked on top of Google for specific commercial keywords, all of these websites link directly to Amazon. Whenever someone decides to visit one of these websites and purchases a product, I receive a commission from Amazon for helping them generate the sale. The third business is a finance lead gen company operating out of Australia, which I acquired at the end of 2020, and also the one where I had to completely max out my bank account in order for the acquisition to go through. It was scary, and a bit risky, but I believed I could turn things around with my SEO knowledge and that‚Äôs exactly what happened, over the next few years the business delivered a 500 + % ROI, and it‚Äôs still one of the best investments I had ever made. Up next we have my software company based in the Netherlands that works with universities, I acquired this business at the end of 2022 with my business partner, it was a mid-6-figure acquisition with significant SEO and conversion rate optimization opportunities. After we finished with the acquisition we managed to scale the monthly recurring revenue by over 750% in just 7 monthsAt the end of 2023, my shiny object syndrome started kicking in again, and I wanted to acquire a new business. After spending months on online business marketplaces, I gave up and decided to partner up with a few clients turned friends, and we ended up launching 3 Shopify brands built on exact match domains. We‚Äôve got 2 out of the 3 businesses launched and profitable with the 3rd business launching any day now, as we finalize the store build-out and conversion rate optimizations. The goal with all of the businesses above is to either build cashflow that can be reinvested into more acquisitions or to build them up and sell them off to a private equity firm. Last but not least, business number 8, is my real estate venture in Cyprus. This business isn‚Äôt really focused on cash flow, but more long term wealth building and capital preservation. The goal is to leverage my network and find distressed properties, that can be either flipped or rented out, as well as to leverage the banks and available capital to acquire real estate, as a long term hedge against inflation. What do all of these businesses have in common?They‚Äôre all built on top of one single skillset, my ability to rank Shopify brands at the top of Google, and drive high-converting free SEO traffic that results in increased Shopify revenue. Throughout the years, my team and I developed a proven process (a checklist) that allows us to rank Shopify brands at the top of Google time and time again. The checklist is designed to save time, help you delegate work seamlessly, and consistently achieve high rankings.üîç Inside the Shopify SEO Checklist:‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Over 135+ Quick-Wins;‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Step-by-Step Guides, Templates & SOPs;‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Incredibly Comprehensive Checklists;‚Ä¢‚Å† Built-in Algorithm That Prioritizes Quick-Wins by ROI;‚úÖ Ideal for:‚Ä¢‚Å† Shopify Store Owners & Entrepreneurs: No more guesswork, just a proven strategy for increased sales.‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Marketing Managers: Set clear SEO goals and enhance team performance.‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Agency Owners & Marketing Consultants: Standardize, delegate, and deliver top-tier Shopify SEO strategies consistently.üí¨ "We were stuck on the 2nd page for a lot of keywords like "teeth whitening", and we needed to perform a much deeper dive to get on to page 1, which is where we are now, thanks to the Shopify SEO Checklist." - Josh Snow, SNOW Teeth Whiteningüëá See it all here

**Ad Text:** My Shopify SEO empire generated $29.6M in the last 24 months, here‚Äôs my story. I started my online business at 12‚Ä¶Fast forward to today, 13 years later, I work with some of the biggest Shopify brands in the world such as FashionNova, BlendJet, FijiWater, SNOW Teeth Whitening, and many others. In the past 24 months, my team and I have generated over $29.6M in Shopify sales with nothing but free organic SEO traffic. It all began when I got my first laptop at 12. I started making phone review videos on YouTube. At 14, I was sponsored by Slovenia‚Äôs biggest carriers, receiving phones to review. At 16, I launched my web design agency, but I soon realized that clients didn‚Äôt just want websites‚Äîthey wanted sales. This realization led me to Google Ads, and eventually SEO, with one goal: generating sales without paying per click. At 19, I was ranking websites internationally and attended the Chiang Mai SEO conference, which inspired me to go all-in on Shopify SEO. In 2020 I moved to Georgia for tax savings, with the goal of reinvesting every cent back into the business, and by the end of 2022, GoldenWeb had over 150 people working globally. Today, I own 8 different online businesses ranging from eCom brands to software, and we‚Äôre on track to becoming the biggest Shopify SEO empire in the world. What‚Äôs the secret behind my success?My Shopify SEO Checklist used by thousands of Shopify SEO Entrepreneurs. üöÄIt‚Äôs a system designed to save time, help you delegate work seamlessly, and consistently achieve high rankings.üîç Inside the Shopify SEO Checklist:‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Over 135+ Quick-Wins;‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Step-by-Step Guides, Templates & SOPs;‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Incredibly Comprehensive Checklists;‚Ä¢‚Å† Built-in Algorithm That Prioritizes Quick-Wins by ROI;‚úÖ Ideal for:‚Ä¢‚Å† Shopify Store Owners & Entrepreneurs: No more guesswork, just a proven strategy for increased sales.‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Marketing Managers: Set clear SEO goals and enhance team performance.‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Agency Owners & Marketing Consultants: Standardize, delegate, and deliver top-tier Shopify SEO strategies consistently.üí¨ "We were stuck on the 2nd page for a lot of keywords like "teeth whitening", and we needed to perform a much deeper dive to get on to page 1, which is where we are now, thanks to the Shopify SEO Checklist." - Josh Snow, SNOW Teeth Whiteningüëá See it all here

So how is this negatively affecting your Shopify rankings and organic revenue?Instead of using Google‚Äôs limited crawl budget on those duplicated URLs, we could be using it to have Google pay more attention to our collections, product, and blog pages, and with that, increase our overall visibility. How do you fix this?It‚Äôs as simple as going into your Shopify theme.liquid file, and disabling dynamic product URLs. This will allow us to link from a collection page directly to the final product page URL, and eliminate all of the other URL variations.

**Ad Text:** You need to adjust this default Shopify SEO setting, otherwise you‚Äôll never be able to rank!Did you know that Shopify auto-generates tons of duplicated, low-quality pages, which totally destroy your indexing rates and your overall organic traffic?Here are 3 different types of auto-generated pages by Shopify, that negatively impact your organic traffic and visibility. First, we have product tags. They‚Äôre great for organizing products into collections, but did you know that every single tag creates a separate page for each collection page on your store?This means if you have 5 collections, using 5 different product tags, you‚Äôll have 25 tagged collection pages, that are low-quality and auto-generated by Shopify. The same happens when you‚Äôre using tags on blog posts to organize them into categories. On top of that, Shopify converts every filter on your collection pages into its own sub-page within that collection. This is kind of ironic because the collections with the most filters are usually also the most popular collections on your store‚Ä¶But due to all these auto-generated filter pages, the rankings of the collections will be suppressed considerably due to all the low-quality filter pages that use them. So what does this mean for your store?Luckily the fix is pretty simple and straightforward. You can keep using tags and filters just like you did in the past‚Ä¶All that you‚Äôd need to do is add a piece of code that tells Google that you don‚Äôt want to index these low-quality pages, and that will hide them from Google‚Äôs index. The reason why this is important is that we want all of Google‚Äôs crawling resources focused on our optimized collection and product pages, since those have the most potential to rank.üëâ Want step-by-step instructions on how to implement this Shopify SEO Quick-Win along with 134 additional Quick-Win opportunities just like this one?Click the link below, and check out the Shopify SEO Checklist with 135 Quick-Wins, Step-by-Step Guides, and over 1,000 happy customers who are using the checklist to scale their store‚Äôs organic traffic and revenue.üëá

**Ad Text:** Building links to Shopify product pages is a waste of time. Your time and linkbuilding budget will deliver a much higher ROI if invested elsewhere. Let‚Äôs be honest and take a look at 3 hard truths here (most SEOs are lying to themselves about these)...#1 Collection pages always outperform product pagesThe ROI of building links to collection pages instead of product pages is drastically higher, as most people prefer picking for products inside a collection, instead of only having a single choice (landing on a product page). Due to search intent alone, you‚Äôre able to rank better with collections, with a lot fewer links required.#2 Links built to product pages are unnaturalI dare you to go through any Shopify store and compare the number of links built to collections and product pages. What you‚Äôll notice is that almost always, collections, blogs, and other pages have way more links built, compared to product pages. With that said, it‚Äôs simply unnatural in the eyes of Google for a product page to have a lot of backlinks.#3 Boost ROI by building links to blogs that interlink to product pagesBuilding links to blog posts is one of the best ways to increase your domain authority while making your website look as legit as possible. Guess what also looks legit?Embedding your products in your blog posts - and this is how to actually go about building links to product pages. Indirectly. Build links to your blog posts featuring your products, that way you can not only boost the blog posts but also your product pages. Best of all?This is just one of the SEO quick-wins that can easily be implemented to any Shopify store. Looking for more?üëá Here are 5 more examples of my favorite technical Shopify SEO quick-wins, for anyone who is sick of leaving organic traffic and revenue on the table.

This means that if you have one product in 5 different collections, you will essentially have 5 completely different URLs. Even though Shopify does include a canonical tag, which tells Google that these pages are the same, Google still needs to do all that extra crawling, just to understand that these pages are not duplicates. So how is this negatively affecting your Shopify rankings and organic revenue?Instead of using Google‚Äôs limited crawl budget on those duplicated URLs, we could be using it to have Google pay more attention to our collections, product, and blog pages, and with that, increase our overall visibility. How do you fix this?It‚Äôs as simple as going into your Shopify theme.liquid file, and disabling dynamic product URLs. This will allow us to link from a collection page directly to the final product page URL, and eliminate all of the other URL variations. Best of all?This doesn‚Äôt turn the OLD URLs into 404 pages, those will still work and load just fine, in case someone lands on them.üëâ Do you want 134 additional Shopify SEO Quick-Win opportunities just like this one?Click the link below, and check out the Shopify SEO Checklist with over 135 Quick-Wins and Step-by-Step Guides, trusted by over 1,000 Shopify Entrepreneurs.üëá

**Ad Text:** Did you know that Shopify auto-generates low-quality tagged pages on your store, which destroys your SEO potential?An example of that would be all the duplicated, low-quality pages that Shopify generates automatically, which totally destroy your indexing rates and your overall organic traffic. Here are 3 different types of auto-generated pages by Shopify, that negatively impact your organic traffic and visibility. First, we have product tags. They‚Äôre great for organizing products into collections, but did you know that every single tag creates a separate page for each collection page on your store?This means if you have 5 collections, using 5 different product tags, you‚Äôll have 25 tagged collection pages, that are low-quality and auto-generated by Shopify. The same happens when you‚Äôre using tags on blog posts to organize them into categories. On top of that, Shopify converts every filter on your collection pages into its own sub-page within that collection. This is kind of ironic because the collections with the most filters are usually also the most popular collections on your store‚Ä¶But due to all these auto-generated filter pages, the rankings of the collections will be suppressed considerably due to all the low-quality filter pages that use them. So what does this mean for your store?Luckily the fix is pretty simple and straightforward. You can keep using tags and filters just like you did in the past‚Ä¶All that you‚Äôd need to do is add a piece of code that tells Google that you don‚Äôt want to index these low-quality pages, and that will hide them from Google‚Äôs index. The reason why this is important is that we want all of Google‚Äôs crawling resources focused on our optimized collection and product pages, since those have the most potential to rank.üëâ Looking for more Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that can be implemented to your store in a matter of minutes to dramatically boost your organic traffic and revenue?Click the link below and read my blog post with my top 5 favorite Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that I‚Äôve used to generate over $29.6M in additional organic revenue for my clients, as well as my own Shopify stores.üëá

By displaying review stars under your search results you will not only boost your organic traffic and conversions but also boost your overall ranking position due to the increased click-through rates. As a result of the increase in click-through rates, Google will naturally move you up in the ranking positions, which results in even more clicks, as you end up ranking higher. More clicks trigger even higher click-through rates, which creates a cycle that allows you to naturally climb all the way to the top of page 1.

**Ad Text:** Building links to product pages is a waste of time. Your time and linkbuilding budget will deliver a much higher ROI if invested elsewhere. Let‚Äôs be honest and take a look at 3 hard facts here (most SEOs are lying to themselves about these)...#1 Collection pages always outperform product pagesThe ROI of building links to collection pages instead of product pages is drastically higher, as most people prefer picking for products inside a collection, instead of only having a single choice (landing on a product page). Due to search intent alone, you‚Äôre able to rank better with collections, with a lot fewer links required.#2 Links built to product pages are unnaturalI dare you to go through any eCom store and compare the number of links built to collections and product pages. What you‚Äôll notice is that almost always, collections, blogs, and other pages have way more links built, compared to product pages. With that said, it‚Äôs simply unnatural in the eyes of Google for a product page to have a lot of backlinks.#3 Boost ROI by building links to blogs that interlink to product pagesBuilding links to blog posts is one of the best ways to increase your domain authority while making your website look as legit as possible. Guess what also looks legit?Embedding your products in your blog posts - and this is how to actually go about building links to product pages. Indirectly. Build links to your blog posts featuring your products, that way you can not only boost the blog posts but also your product pages.üëâ Best of all?This is just one of the SEO quick-wins that can easily be implemented to any Shopify store. Looking for more?üëá Here are 5 more examples of my favorite technical Shopify SEO quick-wins, for anyone who is sick of leaving organic traffic and revenue on the table.

**Ad Text:** Did you know that Shopify auto-generates low-quality tagged pages on your store, which destroys your SEO potential?An example of that would be all the duplicated, low-quality pages that Shopify generates automatically, which totally destroy your indexing rates and your overall organic traffic. Here are 3 different types of auto-generated pages by Shopify, that negatively impact your organic traffic and visibility. First, we have product tags. They‚Äôre great for organizing products into collections, but did you know that every single tag creates a separate page for each collection page on your store?This means if you have 5 collections, using 5 different product tags, you‚Äôll have 25 tagged collection pages, that are low-quality and auto-generated by Shopify. The same happens when you‚Äôre using tags on blog posts to organize them into categories. On top of that, Shopify converts every filter on your collection pages into its own sub-page within that collection. This is kind of ironic because the collections with the most filters are usually also the most popular collections on your store‚Ä¶But due to all these auto-generated filter pages, the rankings of the collections will be suppressed considerably due to all the low-quality filter pages that use them. So what does this mean for your store?Luckily the fix is pretty simple and straightforward. You can keep using tags and filters just like you did in the past‚Ä¶All that you‚Äôd need to do is add a piece of code that tells Google that you don‚Äôt want to index these low-quality pages, and that will hide them from Google‚Äôs index. The reason why this is important is that we want all of Google‚Äôs crawling resources focused on our optimized collection and product pages, since those have the most potential to rank.üëâ Looking for more Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that can be implemented to your store in a matter of minutes to dramatically boost your organic traffic and revenue?Click the link below and read my blog post with my top 5 favorite Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that I‚Äôve used to generate over $29.6M in additional organic revenue for my clients, as well as my own Shopify stores.üëá

**Ad Text:** This Shopify theme setting is destroying your SEO traffic and negatively impacting your overall organic revenue. By default, Shopify is set to generate dynamic URLs for every single product in a collection page. This means that if you have one product in 5 different collections, you will essentially have 5 completely different URLs. Even though Shopify does include a canonical tag, which tells Google that these pages are the same, Google still needs to do all that extra crawling, just to understand that these pages are not duplicates. So how is this negatively affecting your Shopify rankings and organic revenue?Instead of using Google‚Äôs limited crawl budget on those duplicated URLs, we could be using it to have Google pay more attention to our collections, product, and blog pages, and with that, increase our overall visibility. How do you fix this?It‚Äôs as simple as going into your Shopify theme.liquid file, and disabling dynamic product URLs. This will allow us to link from a collection page directly to the final product page URL, and eliminate all of the other URL variations. Best of all?This doesn‚Äôt turn the OLD URLs into 404 pages, they‚Äôll still work and load just fine, in case someone lands on them.üëâ Looking for more Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that can be implemented to your store in a matter of minutes to dramatically boost your organic traffic and revenue?Check my blog post with my top 5 favorite Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that I‚Äôve used to generate over $29.6M in additional organic revenue for my clients, as well as my own Shopify stores.üëá

**Ad Text:** Did you know that you can lift your Shopify store‚Äôs organic traffic by adding a single line of code to your theme.liquid file?One of the first things that Google checks when their crawler lands on your site is your meta robots tag. A meta robots tag tells Google if it should index the page and display it to other users, or not.

**Ad Text:** You need to adjust this default Shopify SEO setting, otherwise you‚Äôll never be able to rank!Did you know that Shopify auto-generates tons of duplicated, low-quality pages, which totally destroy your indexing rates and your overall organic traffic?Here are 3 different types of auto-generated pages by Shopify, that negatively impact your organic traffic and visibility. First, we have product tags. They‚Äôre great for organizing products into collections, but did you know that every single tag creates a separate page for each collection page on your store?This means if you have 5 collections, using 5 different product tags, you‚Äôll have 25 tagged collection pages, that are low-quality and auto-generated by Shopify. The same happens when you‚Äôre using tags on blog posts to organize them into categories. On top of that, Shopify converts every filter on your collection pages into its own sub-page within that collection. This is kind of ironic because the collections with the most filters are usually also the most popular collections on your store‚Ä¶But due to all these auto-generated filter pages, the rankings of the collections will be suppressed considerably due to all the low-quality filter pages that use them. So what does this mean for your store?Luckily the fix is pretty simple and straightforward. You can keep using tags and filters just like you did in the past‚Ä¶All that you‚Äôd need to do is add a piece of code that tells Google that you don‚Äôt want to index these low-quality pages, and that will hide them from Google‚Äôs index. The reason why this is important is that we want all of Google‚Äôs crawling resources focused on our optimized collection and product pages, since those have the most potential to rank.üëâ Want step-by-step instructions on how to implement this Shopify SEO Quick-Win along with 134 additional Quick-Win opportunities just like this one?Click the link below, and check out the Shopify SEO Checklist with 135 Quick-Wins, Step-by-Step Guides, and over 1,000 happy customers who are using the checklist to scale their store‚Äôs organic traffic and revenue.üëá

**Ad Text:** Building links to product pages is a waste of time. Your time and linkbuilding budget will deliver a much higher ROI if invested elsewhere. Let‚Äôs be honest and take a look at 3 hard facts here (most SEOs are lying to themselves about these)...#1 Collection pages always outperform product pagesThe ROI of building links to collection pages instead of product pages is drastically higher, as most people prefer picking for products inside a collection, instead of only having a single choice (landing on a product page). Due to search intent alone, you‚Äôre able to rank better with collections, with a lot fewer links required.#2 Links built to product pages are unnaturalI dare you to go through any eCom store and compare the number of links built to collections and product pages. What you‚Äôll notice is that almost always, collections, blogs, and other pages have way more links built, compared to product pages. With that said, it‚Äôs simply unnatural in the eyes of Google for a product page to have a lot of backlinks.#3 Boost ROI by building links to blogs that interlink to product pagesBuilding links to blog posts is one of the best ways to increase your domain authority while making your website look as legit as possible. Guess what also looks legit?Embedding your products in your blog posts - and this is how to actually go about building links to product pages. Indirectly. Build links to your blog posts featuring your products, that way you can not only boost the blog posts but also your product pages.üëâ Best of all?This is just one of the SEO quick-wins that can easily be implemented to any Shopify store. Looking for more?üëá Here are 5 more examples of my favorite technical Shopify SEO quick-wins, for anyone who is sick of leaving organic traffic and revenue on the table.

**Ad Text:** This Shopify theme setting is destroying your SEO traffic and negatively impacting your overall organic revenue. By default, Shopify is set to generate dynamic URLs for every single product in a collection page. This means that if you have one product in 5 different collections, you will essentially have 5 completely different URLs. Even though Shopify does include a canonical tag, which tells Google that these pages are the same, Google still needs to do all that extra crawling, just to understand that these pages are not duplicates. So how is this negatively affecting your Shopify rankings and organic revenue?Instead of using Google‚Äôs limited crawl budget on those duplicated URLs, we could be using it to have Google pay more attention to our collections, product, and blog pages, and with that, increase our overall visibility. How do you fix this?It‚Äôs as simple as going into your Shopify theme.liquid file, and disabling dynamic product URLs. This will allow us to link from a collection page directly to the final product page URL, and eliminate all of the other URL variations. Best of all?This doesn‚Äôt turn the OLD URLs into 404 pages, they‚Äôll still work and load just fine, in case someone lands on them.üëâ Looking for more Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that can be implemented to your store in a matter of minutes to dramatically boost your organic traffic and revenue?Check my blog post with my top 5 favorite Shopify SEO Quick-Wins that I‚Äôve used to generate over $29.6M in additional organic revenue for my clients, as well as my own Shopify stores.üëá

**Ad Text:** If your Shopify store has over 100 product reviews, there‚Äôs a piece of code you can add to your theme.liquid file that will DOUBLE your organic CTR‚Ä¶By displaying review stars under your search results you will not only boost your organic traffic and conversions but also boost your overall ranking position due to the increased click-through rates. As a result of the increase in click-through rates, Google will naturally move you up in the ranking positions, which results in even more clicks, as you end up ranking higher. More clicks trigger even higher click-through rates, which creates a cycle that allows you to naturally climb all the way to the top of page 1. So how do you actually get this implemented?The easiest way to do it is by reaching out to your Shopify reviews app. Review apps like Okendo, Loox or Stamped have great support teams and they‚Äôll be more than happy to implement it for you, all you need to do is ask. It‚Äôs literally a 2-minute process and definitely one of the HIGHEST ROI Shopify SEO quick-wins available today, so I‚Äôd try and get it implemented as soon as possible.
